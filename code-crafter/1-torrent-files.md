# Understanding `.torrent` Files

A `.torrent` file is a **metadata file used by the BitTorrent protocol** to facilitate peer-to-peer file sharing. It does **not contain the actual content** being shared, but it contains all the information peers need to download and verify the data.

`.torrent` files are **bencoded**, which makes them compact, deterministic, and suitable for distributed systems.
