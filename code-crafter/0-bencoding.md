# Bencoding: A Simple Data Serialization Format

Bencoding (short for **binary encoding**) is a minimal data serialization format originally created for the **BitTorrent protocol**. It is designed to be:

* **Simple** → Easy to parse and generate.
* **Deterministic** → The same data always produces the same encoded form.
* **Compact** → Minimal overhead compared to formats like XML or JSON.
