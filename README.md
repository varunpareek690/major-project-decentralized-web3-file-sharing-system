A peer-to-peer, trackerless file-sharing system inspired by BitTorrent, enhanced with a blockchain layer for integrity, transparency, and incentivization.

## 📖 Overview & Motivation

Traditional file-sharing systems, including many torrenting ecosystems, often rely on centralized trackers for peer discovery. These trackers represent a single point of failure and a target for censorship. If a tracker goes down, the entire swarm can be crippled.

**Project ChainShare** reimagines this process by creating a fully decentralized architecture. Our motivation is to build a resilient, secure, and transparent file-sharing network where:
1.  **No Central Servers Are Needed:** Peers discover each other using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), making the network robust and censorship-resistant.
2.  **Trust is Programmed:** A blockchain layer is used to create an immutable ledger of peer participation, verify file integrity through on-chain hashes, and pave the way for a tokenized economy that rewards users for seeding files (contributing bandwidth).
3.  **Users Control Their Data:** The P2P nature ensures that files are transferred directly between users without passing through an intermediary.
